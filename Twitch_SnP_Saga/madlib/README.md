# Smart Spider's Madlib Journey
### What is this madness?
Steve and Paul (of the OG Steve and Paul Saga), have decided they want to fill out a madlib.
As any good and bored person would do, Steve and Paul decided that picking words themselves would be too easy.
Instead they're going to use a spider to crawl a webpage, scrape the text, then use natural language processing to
pull out the parts of speech needed for the madlib!

<b>Contest:</b> Send madlibs to @levitannin on twitter and yours may be used for testing the spider!
