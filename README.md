# Spider Adventures
The programs found in this repository will be stages of spider adventures, primarily focused on the Darknet.  Some spiders will be useable as a base, while others may be fully functional tools.  If there are requests for specific types of spiders, please reach out to @levitannin and they will consider the request.
